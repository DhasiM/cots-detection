This repo contains code, datasets, and other resources for a model that detects crown-of-thorns starfish in deep seas videos.
It is the collective work of members of the [DSI-2022 Team 3](#Team)

## About the project 

The goal of the competition was to accurately identify starfish in real-time by building an object detection model trained on underwater videos of coral reefs. 

The crown-of-thorns starfish are a particular coral eating starfish that are threatening Australia's Great Barrier Reef. To find and control overpopulation of this species,a traditional reef survey method, called "Manta Tow", is performed by a snorkel diver. While towed by a boat, the divers visually assess the reef, stopping to record variables observed every 200m. This method has obvious limitations. 

The Great Barrier Reef Foundation established an innovation program to develop new survey and control methods. Teaming up with Google, Australiaâ€™s national science agency, CSIRO, aims to develop innovative machine learning technology that can analyse large image datasets accurately, efficiently, and in near real-time.

This repo is DSI-2022 Team 3's attempt to create an object detection model for this purpose.
