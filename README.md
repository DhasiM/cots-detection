# COTS Detection Kaggle - Report will come here...

## Introduction
DSI-2022 Team 3's Protect the Great Barrier Reef Kaggle Competion.

This repo contains code, datasets, and other resources for a model that detects crown-of-thorns starfish in deep seas videos.

This project utilises Feature Branch Workflow. Team members create seperate **branches** for a feature or task. Changes will be pushed to the **develop branch** after reviews. Develop branch will be merged to **main branch for submission**. Each _iteration_ of the working model is equal to one commit in main branch. Other branches have unlimited commits.
